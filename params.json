For example: You have a region (like on a RPG-Server) you want the users to pay for to get the access for it. Just place a button on the wall (you can change the block type in the configuration file) and define it as a trigger. If a player clicks on the button he will buy access to the linked region if he has enough money.\r\n\r\n### What do I need?\r\nRequired plugins are WorldGuard and Vault for region and economy integration. For the regions you just have to define them with WorldGuard.\r\n\r\n### How to create a paid region\r\n\r\nFirst of you need a WorldGuard region. If you don't have one, select an areas with the WorldEdit wand and define it as a region via the `/region define <region>` command. The next step is already the last one: just place a button on the wall, look at it and use the `/pfa create <region> <price>` command."}
